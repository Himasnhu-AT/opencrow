# AI Assistant

This document explains how to use the AI assistant in the ShopDemo application.

The AI assistant is a chat widget that appears in the bottom right corner of the screen. You can use it to interact with the application using natural language.

## Available Commands

Here are some of the things you can ask the assistant to do:

- **Show recent orders:** "Show my recent orders"
- **Open your cart:** "Open my cart"
- **Find products:** "Find wireless headphones"
- **Navigate to a page:** "Go to the products page"

## How it Works

The assistant uses a large language model to understand your requests. It then uses a set of tools to interact with the application on your behalf.

For example, when you ask the assistant to "open my cart", it uses the `open_cart` tool to open the shopping cart.
